`hoice` is a Horn Clause ICE engine.

It infers predicates verifying a set of horn clauses.

`hoice` only supports the `Int` and `Bool` sorts. You can get a sense of the fragment `r_type` supports by looking at [our benchmarks][benchs].

# Install

If you haven't already, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) on your system. The recommended way to do this is to use [`rustup`](https://www.rustup.rs/).

`cargo` installation:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/hopv/hoice
```

To build `hoice` manually, clone this repository `cd` in the directory and run

```bash
cargo build --release
```
The binary file will be in `target/release/hoice`.

To get the fastest version, compile `hoice` with

```bash
cargo build --release --features "bench"
```

Note that this disables some features such as verbosity.


## z3

`hoice` relies on the [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) SMT-solver. Make sure you have a relatively recent version of the z3 binary in your path.


# Language

[Consult the wiki](https://github.com/hopv/hoice/wiki/Language) for a description of `hoice`'s language.


# Features

Sorts supported:

- [x] `Bool`
- [x] `Int`
- [x] `Real` (experimental)
- [ ] `List`
- [ ] (mutually recursive) ADTs

Future features:

- [ ] `define-fun`s
- [ ] user-specified qualifiers through `define-fun`s


# Checking the result

`hoice` can check its own results. The code performing this feature is completely separated from the code doing the actual inference so that the check is meaningful.

In fact, the code for this is almost implemented as some string substitutions followed by an SMT query for each clause of the problem.

For now, this feature is completely off-line. Put `hoice`'s result in a file, for instance with

```bash
hoice <horn_clause_file> | tee <output_file>
```

and use the `--check` option to verify that the predicates inferred verify all the horn clauses:

```bash
hoice --check <output_file> <horn_clause_file>
```
